# SMS-SPAM-DETECTION

#  Objective:
- Develop a machine learning model to automatically detect spam messages in SMS communications.

# Components Used: 
  - **Vectorizer**: Converts text messages into numerical vectors, essential for machine learning algorithms to process text data.
  - **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**: A probabilistic classifier suitable for text classification tasks, effective in handling discrete features like word counts.

  # Data Handling: 
  - Utilizes a labeled dataset of SMS messages categorized as spam or legitimate (ham).
  - Implements data preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization to prepare the data for model training.

  # Model Training and Evaluation: 
  - **Training**: The MultinomialNB model learns from the vectorized SMS data to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages.
  - **Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy score, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizes results with confusion matrices to analyze prediction outcomes.

  # Repository Content: 
  - Includes Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  - Detailed README providing setup instructions, dependencies, and usage guidelines for replicating the project.

  # Deployment and Use Case: 
  - Suitable for educational purposes to understand text classification in machine learning.
  - Demonstrates practical application for spam detection in SMS communications, with potential for adaptation to other text classification tasks.

**This project serves as an educational resource and practical example of leveraging machine learning techniques to tackle spam detection in SMS messages, emphasizing data preprocessing, model implementation, and performance evaluation.**
